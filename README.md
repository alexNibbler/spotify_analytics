# spotify_analytics
Data analytics project on Spotify music 2010-2019 dataset

The project has just begun, so this Readme file is currently focused on the goals. Here are the directions we'll try to analyze:
1.⁠ ⁠What audio features correlate with popularity?
2.⁠ ⁠Trends in genres over the years
3.⁠ ⁠Trends in artists over the years
4.⁠ ⁠Compare popular tracks vs less popular tracks in terms of their characteristics (e.g. tempo, energy, etc.)
