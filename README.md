# spotify_analytics
Data analytics project on Spotify music 2010-2019 dataset. Here is the dataset source and description https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leonardopena/top-spotify-songs-from-20102019-by-year

The project has just begun, so this Readme file is currently focused on the goals. Here are the directions we'll try to analyze:
1. What audio features correlate with popularity? 
2. Trends in genres over the years 
3. Trends in artists over the years 
4. Compare popular tracks vs less popular tracks in terms of their characteristics (e.g. tempo, energy, etc.)
